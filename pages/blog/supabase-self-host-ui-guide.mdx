## What is Supabase?

Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides developers with a complete solution for building applications. It offers a real-time database, authentication, and storage, making it an effective alternative to Firebase. Supabase is built on top of PostgreSQL, allowing users to leverage the power of a robust relational database while enjoying a straightforward and user-friendly interface. The key features include:

- **Real-time subscriptions**: Enables applications to respond instantly to changes in the database.
- **Authentication**: Provides a secure way to manage users with built-in authentication tools.
- **Storage**: Simplifies file storage with an easy-to-use API for managing files.

For a more in-depth understanding of Supabase, check out the [official documentation](https://supabase.io/docs).

## Key Features of Supabase
